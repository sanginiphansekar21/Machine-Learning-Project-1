# Machine-Learning-Project-1
Mercedeze Benze Greener Manufacturing Project -Done the anaysis on given Dataset to representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards.
For that Following actions performed:
* If for any column(s), the variance is equal to zero, then need to remove those variable(s).
* Check for null and unique values for test and train sets
* Apply label encoder.
* Perform dimensionality reduction.
* Predict test_df values using xgboost
